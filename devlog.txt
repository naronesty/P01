We decided on how our website would evolve past V0 by adding in features that deal with customization to make profiles tailored to user's needs. We decided on using bootstrap as our frontend framework and started working on the design document.

Made the website work and not show a 404 error.
It now displays a random joke from any category and doesn't break on one line jokes.
It excludes nsfw, racist and sexist jokes as well.
Also added to requirements.txt
