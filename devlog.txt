We decided on how our website would evolve past V0 by adding in features that deal with customization to make profiles tailored to user's needs. We decided on using bootstrap as our frontend framework and started working on the design document.

Moved the database to a separate file
Added in the CatFacts API so the website shows a random catFact each time

User now starts in home.html and clicking GENERATE! takes them to furrbook.html
Added the 3 profile stubs and slider
Unsure how to get user info from dropdowns and sliders

annabelZ -- 2021-12-13 18:07
Commented out original button code; added a Bootstrap feature called "select" for dropdowns instead (lines 63-73).
Added accompanying Javascript (lines 20-26) to get the value of the dropdown; currently set to issuing an alert if a template is selected.

hebeH -- 2021-12-13 18:32
Used Flask to take in user selection of template; generate button now renders the template the user selected
Deleted old button code because new one works and made a genre dropdown with the new "select" feature
